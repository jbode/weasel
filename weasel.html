      <h1>Methinks it is like a weasel</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Weasel page!</p>
      <h2>What is this thing?</h2>
    <p>This is my spin on Richard Dawkins' WEASEL program as described in Chapter 3
       of "The Blind Watchmaker". This program is an illustration of a key concept
       within biological evolution - random variation coupled with non-random <em>cumulative</em> selection.
    <p>This program attempts to match a string (the target) by starting with a population
       of randomly generated strings.  These strings are compared against the target string and "scored"
       based on how closely they match the target.  Scoring is determined by adding up the differences
       between encodings of individual characters in the candidate and target string.  For example,
       "ab" and "bc" have a cumulative difference of 2, because the encodings for the 
       characters 'a' and 'b' differ by 1 and the encodings for 'b' and 'c' differ by 1.  The lower the score, 
       the closer the match to the target.  
    <p>Strings are then sorted based on score, and the bottom 90% are thrown away.
       The remaining 10% are copied with mutations to replace the bottom 90% (population size
       is fixed), and the process repeats with a new generation of strings.  As each character
       is copied from the source to the target, the program rolls a virtual 100 sided die, and
       depending on the result, one of the following "mutations" occurs:
      <ul>
        <li>No change (a -&gt; a) - the character from the source string is copied to the destination string with no changes.
        <li>Point change (a -&gt; b) - the character from the source string is discarded, and a replacement character 
            is chosen at random from the alphabet and written to the destination string.
        <li>Duplication (a -&gt; aa ) - the character from the source string is copied to the destination
            string twice.
        <li>Deletion (ab -&gt; b) - the character from the source string is discarded, and nothing
            is written to the destination string.
        <li>Transposition (ab -&gt; ba) - the next two characters from the source string are
            copied to the destination string in reverse order.
      </ul> 
       By default, point changes, duplications, deletions, and transpositions each have a 1%
       chance of occurring, meaning that there's a 96% chance that a character will be copied
       with no change.   
    <p>Each generation, the string with the lowest score is picked as the best fit and, if it is different from the
       previous best fit, is displayed in the output table.

    <h2>What <em>isn't</em> this thing?</h2>
    <p>This is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> meant to be a model of biological evolution, and neither was
       Dawkins' original program.  This is simply an illustration of the power of cumulative selection to
       reach a given target, compared to randomly generating a string and throwing the whole thing away
       when it doesn't match.  
    <p>Part of my motivation for writing the original C program this page is derived from was to address
       a criticism of William Dembski's that Dawkins' program "locked" letters into place once matched.
       Dawkins' original program doesn't do that, and neither does mine.  Every character in every
       string is subject to mutation every generation.  It only <em>looks</em> like characters are
       locked into place because as we get closer to a match, fewer characters need to change.  
    <h2>Running the thing</h2>
    <p>The form below is used to enter the parameters for the Weasel program:
    <ul>
      <li>Target - the string we're trying to match;
      <li>Alphabet - the character set from which strings are generated (all the characters in the target <em>must</em> be 
      present in the alphabet);
      <li>Point change probability - the probability of a point change during a copy, expressed as a whole number
      between 1 and 97;
      <li>Duplicate change probability - the probability of a duplication during a copy, expressed as a whole number
      between 1 and 97;
      <li>Deletion change probability - the probability of a deletion during a copy, expressed as a whole number between 
      1 and 97;
      <li>Transposition probability - the probability of a transposition during a copy, expressed as a whole number between
      1 and 97;
      <li>Population size - the number of strings in the "breeding" population;
      <li>Initial string length - the length of the strings in the initial population;
    </ul>
    <p>Probabilities <em>must</em> be between 1 and 97 - there must be at least a 1% chance of each type of mutation,
       otherwise there's no way to get from the randomly generated string to the target.  If the total of point, duplicate,
       delete, and transpose probabilities is less than 100, then the difference is the probability of no change (i.e., 
       since the default value for each type is 1%, then there's a 96% chance of no change).
    <p>The larger the population size, the fewer generations are required to reach a match (typically).  The flip side of
       that is larger populations take up more memory, and each generation takes longer to process.
    <p>Somewhat paradoxically, higher mutation rates result in the program taking more generations to reach the target.  
       Specifying a rate of 10 or more for any mutation type may cause the program to run for an excessive amount of time.   
    <p>This is also my first adventure in Javascript, so there will be some weirdness
       in how this page behaves.  I'm figuring things out as I go.
